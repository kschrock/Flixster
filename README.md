### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt that everything in class we learned applied to this assignment. I think if we went over a libray like Bootstrap it would have helped people for the CSS part because CSS seems to have alot to learn. While Bootstrap comes with alot of bulit in CSS for quick building. 

The lab the really clicked everything for me was lab 3 dealing with API and appending gifs. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would look into the 404 error when the API does not have an image or other information about the movie, so then I would fix this error. Also, I would have more checking involved
if a variables has null information I would make a default value to like 0 or not found. I would also implement having embedded videos. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Overall, I think the project demo went well! 😎 I do think I could have made the UI better along with having embedded vidoes in the pop-ups. I seen another person create the search input to query automatically while typing, which I thought was cool!
